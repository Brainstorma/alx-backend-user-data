# 0x02-Session_authentication

This project is about implementing a session authentication mechanism without installing any other module. The learning objectives of the project include:

- Understanding authentication, session authentication.
- Cookies, sending cookies, and parsing cookies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask 1.1.x
- bcrypt 3.1.x
- PyJWT 2.0.x
- MongoDB 4.4.x

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Brainstorma>/0x02-Session_authentication.git
cd 0x02-Session_authentication
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Start the Flask server:

```bash
FLASK_APP=api/v1/app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```

The server will listen on `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`.

## Tasks

The project consists of 11 tasks:

### [User model](^1^)

Create a user model that inherits from `BaseModel` and has the following attributes:

- `id`: a string that is the primary key of the user.
- `email`: a string that is the email of the user and is unique.
- `hashed_password`: a string that is the hashed password of the user.
- `session_id`: a string that is the session ID of the user.

The user model should also have the following class methods:

- `def find_by_email(email: str) -> User:` that returns the user instance based on the email, or `None` if not found.
- `def get_reset_password_token(email: str) -> str:` that generates a reset password token for the user based on the email, or raises a `ValueError` if the email is not valid.
- `def update_password(reset_token: str, password: str) -> None:` that updates the hashed password of the user based on the reset token, or raises a `ValueError` if the token is not valid.

The user model should also have the following instance methods:

- `def is_valid_password(password: str) -> bool:` that checks if the password is valid for the user.
- `def create_session(self) -> str:` that creates a new session ID for the user and returns it.
- `def destroy_session(self) -> None:` that removes the session ID from the user.

### [Session authentication](^2^)

Create an abstract class `Auth` that defines an authentication mechanism and has the following methods:

- `def require_auth(self, path: str, excluded_paths: List[str]) -> bool:` that returns `True` if the path requires authentication, or `False` otherwise.
- `def authorization_header(self, request=None) -> str:` that returns the value of the authorization header in a request, or `None` if none.
- `def current_user(self, request=None) -> TypeVar('User'):` that returns the current user instance based on the request, or `None` if none.

Create a subclass `SessionAuth` that inherits from `Auth` and implements session authentication. It should have an attribute `_user_id_by_session_id` that is a dictionary where the key is a session ID and the value is a user ID.

The subclass should also override and implement the following methods:

- `def create_session(self, user_id: str = None) -> str:` that creates a new session for a user and returns the session ID, or `None` if none.
- `def user_id_for_session_id(self, session_id: str = None) -> str:` that returns the user ID based on the session ID, or `None` if none.
- `def current_user(self, request=None) -> TypeVar('User'):` that returns the current user instance based on the request, or `None` if none.
- `def destroy_session(self, request=None) -> bool:` that deletes the current session and returns `True`, or `False` if none.

### [Use SessionAuth](^3^)

Update your API to use your new SessionAuth class instead of BasicAuth. You will need to import your SessionAuth class in your app.py file and instantiate an object of it named auth.

You will also need to update your routes to use your new authentication mechanism. For example:

```python
@app.route('/users/me', methods=['GET'], strict_slashes=False)
def get_user_me() -> str:
    """Get current user"""
    user = auth.current_user(request)
    if not user:
        abort(403)
    return jsonify(user.to_json())
```

You will also need to update your tests to use cookies instead of headers for authentication. For example:

```python
def test_user_me(self):
    """Test user me route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.get(
            '/users/me',
            headers=self.auth_header
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json, self.user_1.to_json())
```

should be changed to:

```python
def test_user_me(self):
    """Test user me route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.get(
            '/users/me',
            cookies=self.auth_cookie
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json, self.user_1.to_json())
```

### [Session cookie]

Update your SessionAuth class to store the session ID as a cookie in the response and retrieve it from the request. You will need to use the `set_cookie` and `get_cookie` methods from the Flask `request` and `response` objects.

You will also need to define two constants in your auth.py file:

- `SESSION_NAME`: a string that is the name of the cookie used for authentication.
- `SESSION_DURATION`: an integer that is the number of seconds the cookie will be valid.

You will also need to update your tests to check for the presence and validity of the cookie in the response. For example:

```python
def test_login(self):
    """Test login route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.post(
            '/auth_session/login',
            data={'email': self.email_1, 'password': self.password_1}
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json, {'email': self.email_1, 'message': 'logged in'})
```

should be changed to:

```python
def test_login(self):
    """Test login route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.post(
            '/auth_session/login',
            data={'email': self.email_1, 'password': self.password_1}
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json, {'email': self.email_1, 'message': 'logged in'})
        cookie = response.headers.get('Set-Cookie')
        self.assertIn(SESSION_NAME, cookie)
```

### [Logout]

Create a new route `/auth_session/logout` that deletes the current session and redirects the user to `/`. The route should only accept `DELETE` methods and use your SessionAuth class for authentication.

You will also need to update your tests to check for the deletion of the cookie in the response. For example:

```python
def test_logout(self):
    """Test logout route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.delete(
            '/auth_session/logout',
            cookies=self.auth_cookie
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
        self.assertEqual(response.location, 'http://localhost/')
```

should be changed to:

```python
def test_logout(self):
    """Test logout route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.delete(
            '/auth_session/logout',
            cookies=self.auth_cookie
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)
        self.assertEqual(response.location, 'http://localhost/')
        cookie = response.headers.get('Set-Cookie')
        self.assertIn('{}=;'.format(SESSION_NAME), cookie)
```

### [User profile]

Create a new route `/profile` that displays the profile of the current user based on the session ID. The route should only accept `GET` methods and use your SessionAuth class for authentication.

The profile should include the following information:

- Email
- First name
- Last name
- Biography

You will also need to create a template file named `profile.html` in your `templates` folder that renders the profile information using Jinja2.

You will also need to update your tests to check for the content of the profile page. For example:

```python
def test_profile(self):
    """Test profile route"""
    with self.client as c:
        response = c.get(
            '/profile',
            cookies=self.auth_cookie
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertIn(b'Email: user_1@gmail.com', response.data)
```

### [Password reset]

Create a new route `/reset_password` that allows the user to reset their password by entering their email and a new password. The route should only accept `POST` methods and use your SessionAuth class for authentication.

The route should also send an email to the user with a link to confirm their password reset. The link should contain a token generated by your User model's `get_reset_password_token` method.

You will also need to create a template file named `reset_password.html` in your `templates` folder that renders a form for resetting the password using Jinja2.

You will also need to update your tests to check for the

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Et moi et moi et moi!**
  + Copy all your work of the [0x06. Basic authentication](../0x01-Basic_authentication/) project in this new folder.
  + In this version, you implemented a **Basic authentication** for giving you access to all User endpoints:
    + `GET /api/v1/users`.
    + `POST /api/v1/users`.
    + `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>`.
    + `PUT /api/v1/users/<user_id>`.
    + `DELETE /api/v1/users/<user_id>`.
  + Now, you will add a new endpoint: `GET /users/me` to retrieve the authenticated `User` object.
    + Copy folders `models` and `api` from the previous project [0x06. Basic authentication](../0x01-Basic_authentication/).
    + Please make sure all mandatory tasks of this previous project are done at 100% because this project (and the rest of this track) will be based on it.
    + Update `@app.before_request` in [api/v1/app.py](api/v1/app.py):
      + Assign the result of `auth.current_user(request)` to `request.current_user`.
    + Update method for the route `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>` in [api/v1/views/users.py](api/v1/views/users.py):
      + If `<user_id>` is equal to `me` and `request.current_user` is `None`: `abort(404)`.
      + If `<user_id>` is equal to `me` and `request.current_user` is not `None`: return the authenticated `User` in a JSON response (like a normal case of `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>` where `<user_id>` is a valid `User` ID)
      + Otherwise, keep the same behavior.

+ [x] 1. **Empty session**
  + Create a class `SessionAuth` in [api/v1/auth/session_auth.py](api/v1/auth/session_auth.py) that inherits from `Auth`. For the moment this class will be empty. It's the first step for creating a new authentication mechanism:
    + Validate if everything inherits correctly without any overloading.
    + Validate the "switch" by using environment variables.
  + Update [api/v1/app.py](api/v1/app.py) for using `SessionAuth` instance for the variable `auth` depending on the value of the environment variable `AUTH_TYPE`, If `AUTH_TYPE` is equal to `session_auth`:
    + Import `SessionAuth` from [api.v1.auth.session_auth](api.v1.auth.session_auth)
    + Create an instance of `SessionAuth` and assign it to the variable auth
    Otherwise, keep the previous mechanism.

+ [x] 2. **Create a session**
  + Update `SessionAuth` class:
    + Create a class attribute `user_id_by_session_id` initialized by an empty dictionary.
    + Create an instance method `def create_session(self, user_id: str = None) -> str:` that creates a Session ID for a `user_id`:
    + Return `None` if `user_id` is `None`.
    + Return `None` if `user_id` is not a string.
    + Otherwise:
      + Generate a Session ID using `uuid` module and `uuid4()` like `id` in `Base`.
      + Use this Session ID as key of the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id` - the value for this key must be `user_id`.
      + Return the Session ID.
    + The same `user_id` can have multiple Session ID - indeed, the `user_id` is the value in the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id`.
  + Now you an "in-memory" Session ID storing. You will be able to retrieve an `User` id based on a Session ID.

+ [x] 3. **User ID for Session ID**
  + Update `SessionAuth` class:
  + Create an instance method `def user_id_for_session_id(self, session_id: str = None) -> str:` that returns a `User` ID based on a Session ID:
    + Return `None` if `session_id` is `None`.
    + Return `None` if `session_id` is not a string.
    + Return the value (the User ID) for the key `session_id` in the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id`.
    + You must use `.get()` built-in for accessing in a dictionary a value based on key.
  + Now you have 2 methods (`create_session` and `user_id_for_session_id`) for storing and retrieving a link between a User ID and a Session ID.

+ [x] 4. **Session cookie**
  + Update [api/v1/auth/auth.py](api/v1/auth/auth.py) by adding the method `def session_cookie(self, request=None):` that returns a cookie value from a request:
    + Return `None` if `request` is `None`.
    + Return the value of the cookie named `_my_session_id` from `request` - the name of the cookie must be defined by the environment variable `SESSION_NAME`.
    + You must use `.get()` built-in for accessing the cookie in the request cookies dictionary.
    + You must use the environment variable `SESSION_NAME` to define the name of the cookie used for the Session ID.

+ [x] 5. **Before request**
  + Update the `@app.before_request` method in [api/v1/app.py](api/v1/app.py):
    + Add the URL path `/api/v1/auth_session/login/` in the list of excluded paths of the method `require_auth` - this route doesn't exist yet but it should be accessible outside authentication
    + If `auth.authorization_header(request)` and `auth.session_cookie(request)` return `None`, `abort(401)`

+ [x] 6. **Use Session ID for identifying a User**
  + Update `SessionAuth` class:

  + Create an instance method `def current_user(self, request=None):` (overload) that returns a `User` instance based on a cookie value:

    + You must use `self.session_cookie(...)` and `self.user_id_for_session_id(...)` to return the User ID based on the cookie `_my_session_id`.
    + By using this User ID, you will be able to retrieve a `User` instance from the database - you can use `User.get(...)` for retrieving a `User` from the database.
  + Now, you will be able to get a User based on his session ID.

+ [x] 7. **New view for Session Authentication**
  + Create a new Flask view that handles all routes for the Session authentication.
  + In the file [api/v1/views/session_auth.py](api/v1/views/session_auth.py), create a route `POST /auth_session/login` (= `POST /api/v1/auth_session/login`):
    + Slash tolerant (`/auth_session/login` == `/auth_session/login/`).
    + You must use `request.form.get()` to retrieve `email` and `password` parameters.
    + If `email` is missing or empty, return the JSON `{ "error": "email missing" }` with the status code `400`.
    + If `password` is missing or empty, return the JSON `{ "error": "password missing" }` with the status code `400`.
    + Retrieve the `User` instance based on the `email` - you must use the class method `search` of `User` (same as the one used for the `BasicAuth`).
      + If no `User` found, return the JSON `{ "error": "no user found for this email" }` with the status code `404`.
      + If the `password` is not the one of the `User` found, return the JSON `{ "error": "wrong password" }` with the status code `401` - you must use `is_valid_password` from the `User` instance.
      + Otherwise, create a Session ID for the `User` ID:
        + You must use from `api.v1.app import auth` - **WARNING: please import it only where you need it** - not on top of the file (can generate circular import - and break first tasks of this project).
        + You must use `auth.create_session(..)` for creating a Session ID.
        + Return the dictionary representation of the `User` - you must use `to_json()` method from User.
        + You must set the cookie to the response - you must use the value of the environment variable `SESSION_NAME` as cookie name - [tip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26587485/can-a-cookie-be-set-when-using-jsonify).
  + In the file [api/v1/views/__init__.py](api/v1/views/__init__.py), you must add this new view at the end of the file.
  + Now you have an authentication based on a Session ID stored in cookie, perfect for a website (browsers love cookies).

+ [x] 8. **Logout**
  + Update the class `SessionAuth` by adding a new method `def destroy_session(self, request=None):` that deletes the user session / logout:
    + If the `request` is equal to `None`, return `False`.
    + If the `request` doesn't contain the Session ID cookie, return `False` - you must use `self.session_cookie(request)`.
    + If the Session ID of the request is not linked to any User ID, return `False` - you must use self.`user_id_for_session_id(...)`.
    + Otherwise, delete in `self.user_id_by_session_id` the Session ID (as key of this dictionary) and return `True`.
  + Update the file [api/v1/views/session_auth.py](api/v1/views/session_auth.py), by adding a new route `DELETE /api/v1/auth_session/logout`:
    + Slash tolerant.
    + You must use `from api.v1.app import auth`.
    + You must use `auth.destroy_session(request)` for deleting the Session ID contents in the request as cookie:
      + If `destroy_session` returns `False`, `abort(404)`.
      + Otherwise, return an empty JSON dictionary with the status code `200`.

+ [x] 9. **Expiration?**
  + Actually you have 2 authentication systems:
    + Basic authentication.
    + Session authentication.
  + Now you will add an expiration date to a Session ID.
  + Create a class `SessionExpAuth` that inherits from `SessionAuth` in the file [api/v1/auth/session_exp_auth.py](api/v1/auth/session_exp_auth.py):
    + Overload `def __init__(self):` method:
      + Assign an instance attribute `session_duration`:
        + To the environment variable `SESSION_DURATION` casts to an integer.
        + If this environment variable doesn't exist or can't be parse to an integer, assign to 0.
    + Overload `def create_session(self, user_id=None):`:
      + Create a Session ID by calling `super()` - `super()` will call the `create_session()` method of `SessionAuth`.
      + Return `None` if `super()` can't create a Session ID.
      + Use this Session ID as key of the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id` - the value for this key must be a dictionary (called "session dictionary"):
        + The key `user_id` must be set to the variable `user_id`.
        + The key `created_at` must be set to the current datetime - you must use `datetime.now()`.
      + Return the Session ID created.
    + Overload `def user_id_for_session_id(self, session_id=None):`:
      + Return `None` if `session_id` is `None`.
      + Return `None` if `user_id_by_session_id` doesn't contain any key equals to `session_id`.
      + Return the `user_id` key from the session dictionary if `self.session_duration` is equal or under 0.
      + Return `None` if session dictionary doesn't contain a key `created_at`.
      + Return `None` if the `created_at` + `session_duration` seconds are before the current datetime. [datetime - timedelta](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects).
      + Otherwise, return `user_id` from the `session` dictionary.
  + Update [api/v1/app.py](api/v1/app.py) to instantiate `auth` with `SessionExpAuth` if the environment variable `AUTH_TYPE` is equal to `session_exp_auth`.

+ [x] 10. **Sessions in database**
  + Since the beginning, all Session IDs are stored in memory. It means, if your application stops, all Session IDs are lost.
  + To avoid that, you will create a new authentication system, based on Session ID stored in database (for us, it will be in a file, like `User`).
  + Create a new model `UserSession` in [models/user_session.py](models/user_session.py) that inherits from `Base`:
    + Implement the `def __init__(self, *args: list, **kwargs: dict):` like in `User` but for these 2 attributes:
      + `user_id`: string.
      + `session_id`: string.
  + Create a new authentication class `SessionDBAuth` in [api/v1/auth/session_db_auth.py](api/v1/auth/session_db_auth.py) that inherits from `SessionExpAuth`:
    + Overload `def create_session(self, user_id=None):` that creates and stores new instance of `UserSession` and returns the Session ID.
    + Overload `def user_id_for_session_id(self, session_id=None):` that returns the User ID by requesting `UserSession` in the database based on `session_id`.
    + Overload `def destroy_session(self, request=None):` that destroys the `UserSession` based on the Session ID from the request cookie.
  + Update [api/v1/app.py](api/v1/app.py) to instantiate `auth` with `SessionDBAuth` if the environment variable `AUTH_TYPE` is equal to `session_db_auth`.
